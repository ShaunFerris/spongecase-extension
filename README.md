# spongecase-extension
A simple Chrome browser extension that lets you mock people by copying their comments (or any other text) and converting it to "sPOnGecAsE".

Highlight any text in your current chrome tab and hit the hotkey "Ctrl+Shift+Q", and the text as spongecase will be copied to your clipboard and ready to be pasted.
