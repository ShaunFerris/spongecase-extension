A simple Chrome browser extension that lets you mock people by copying their comments (or any other text) and converting it to "sPOnGecAsE".

### Installation
The extension is not published on the chrome store. To install:
1. Clone this repo or otherwise download the files
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your chrome browser
3. Enable developer mode, then click load unpacked extension and select the folder containing the repo.
4. Thats it!

### Usage
Highlight any text in your current chrome tab and hit the hotkey "Ctrl+Shift+Q", and the text as spongecase will be copied to your clipboard and ready to be pasted.
You can change the assigned hotkey by editing the manifest file and reloading the extension.
